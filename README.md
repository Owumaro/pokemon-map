## Demo

You can see a demo hosted at OpenShift [here](http://pkmmap-owumaro.rhcloud.com) (when OpenShift doesn't idle it).

## About

Pokémon map is a very basic experiment (my first) with socket.io. The goal is to have multiple players on a Pokémon map (I choosed the FireRed/LeafGreen Pallet Town), and to be able to see other players moving in real time.
I also added a chat to provide a way to curse at other people. :smile:

I used `jQuery` and `bootstrap` for the client side program. I know the code is quite messy, I would like to switch to Angular.js but I don't have time right now. Also, Bootstrap style is in contradiction with the "retro pixel" style.

## Instructions

You need `node`, `npm` and `bower`.

Run `npm install` and `bower install` to get dependencies.

You can now run `node server.js` and open your browser at `127.0.0.1:8080`.
