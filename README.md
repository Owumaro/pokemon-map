## Introduction

Pokémon map is a very basic experiment (my first) with socket.io. The goal is to have multiple players on a Pokémon map (I choosed the FireRed/LeafGreen Pallet Town), and to be able to see other players moving in real time.
I also added a chat to provide ways to curse at other people. :>

I used jQuery and Bootstrap for the client side program. I know it's quite messy, I would like to try Angular.js but I don't have time right now. Also, Bootstrap style is in contradiction with the "retro pixel" style.

## Instructions

You need `node`, `npm` and `bower`.

Run `npm install` and `bower install` to get dependencies.

You can now run `node server.js` and open your browser at `127.0.0.1:8080`.
